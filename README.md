# Clinical Trial
There are three types of actors:
There is a hospital that is called the «initiator»: who has the research idea and set the trial protocol
There are hospitals that are called the «collaborators»: who participate in the clinical trial by running the experiment defined by the initiator using their data
There is one «ethical committee» internal to the «initiator»

## Members:
* member A (Ahmed Mahmoud Abdelmoneim, Abdelhamid, 11052203) 
* member B (Amr Ahmed Yehia Elsaid, Elmasry, 11036293)

## Choreographed process
This BPMN Choreography Model represents the collaborative process of defining and executing a clinical trial. The workflow involves three key actors:

Initiator Hospital – Develops the research idea, defines the trial protocol, and submits it for approval.

Ethical Committee – Reviews the trial protocol and decides whether to approve or reject it.

Collaborator Hospitals – Execute the trial according to the approved protocol and contribute their data for evaluation.

The process begins with the Initiator Hospital defining the clinical trial protocol, which is then submitted to the Ethical Committee for review. If approved, the trial is executed by the Collaborator Hospitals, and data is collected and evaluated. If the protocol is rejected, it must be revised and resubmitted.
